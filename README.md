# FileHosting (file io analog)
I want to show my analog of the File io service. Anyone can download ‘html’, ‘css’, ‘js’, ‘png’, ‘jpg’, ‘jpeg’, ‘gif’, ‘ico’, ‘svg’. I made this project in a couple days because limeware messed up the file io project. You can use it, make forks, etc. The standard limit is 16mb, but you can spell ‘'app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH’] = 50 * 1024 * 1024 # 50 MB'' - this is to increase to 50 mb

## Screenshots
You can see the html site itself
